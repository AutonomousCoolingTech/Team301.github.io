# Design Concept 1

* The first concept allowed for a stationary product where it can be placed in a majority of places which have flat surfaces like that of a table or wall. One concept that could improve this design would be integrating multi-surface sides that do not include the sensors in order to be attached to many different materials (adhesive, magnetic, velcro). The design allows for an external fan outside the box to make sure that the fan (motor) can help cool off the user when the temperature gauge reaches dangerously high levels and cool off the user or whatever needs to be cooled off. This design also uses a miniature radar component to make sure of sporadic changes within weather conditions and displays a warning with a loudspeaker to ensure the user to either evacuate or be cautious of the weather conditions.

# Design Concept 2

*The second design ensures that the product can be mobile and can be taken with the user with it being worn like a small necklace around the neck with a string attached to the cap of the container to ensure it doesn’t get lost. This concept allows for the fan to remain inside the capsule along with the integration of the temperature sensor to allow the fan to activate when the user is in dangerously heated conditions. This concept allows the user to have a handheld or neckheld product with sensors reading temperature, which is connected to the fan, and an ultrasonic sensor to work as a small radar with changing weather conditions. This design is more compact and needs to be smaller than the first in order to be wrapped around the neck of an individual and needs to be lighter than the first product in order to do so. 

# Design Concept 3

* The final concept which is similar to the first concept except the design having more of a circular or spherical shape with a flat bottom. This means that the product can be much easier to make portable and can even be placed into someone’s pocket with its smoother surfaces and round shape roughly the size of a tennis ball. The sensors are placed on the 3 bases of the product to ensure that they are external and can read changes in the atmosphere correctly and efficiently instead of being placed on the inside of the product. This design is more difficult to form than design 1, but in doing so it is sleeker than design one and has less surface area to take up within a room and can be placed in areas where it would not be suitable for a cubic object like our first design.
