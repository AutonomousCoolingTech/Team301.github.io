How will your team communicate (e.g., group text, email, Canvas, slack, discord, telephone)? 
Consider the need for both asynchronous and synchronous discussion types, and the expectations that come with each mode of communication.
* We have all agreed that we will communicate through text (personal cell phones). We already created a text group chat with everyone involved.

How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?
* Since we are a team, everyone is expected to be responsible. Communication with each other will be in person and through text, depending on whether we are all there present or not.

## Team Goals
Ensuring that our device can benefit the user and help them within different environments with changing conditions
Deepen our expertise with different operating systems with new and improved features (sensors)
Getting started early on our project to have the most benefits with troubleshooting and correcting while being ahead of the project schedule
Making sure that our product can be operable during different environments and can be small and portable enough to be taken anywhere
Ensuring that our product can possibly assist and help our users within different and dangerous conditions with its warning systems and cooling systems

## Team Mission Statement
Our teamâ€™s mission is to create and sell a product that will ensure proper safety conditions within different environments when working with a mobile weather station. Our goal is to ensure that our device can properly detect dangerous changes within different environments and help the user become aware of said changes along with providing some emergency relief for these changes.

## Meeting Schedule
Your team should identify common times for meeting every week. If you are not meeting weekly, your team's chances of success this semester are low
Fill out the linked template. Put abbreviations next to hours in the week you are certain you will be generally available throughout the semester. Consider external hard constraints in a typical week, such as other classes, work, transit, meals, or family commitments.
Identify at least four hours shared by the team outside of class time.
Select a weekly meeting slot (it can be changed later, but you should try one for the first couple weeks).
Add the meeting to your team's agreed-upon scheduling approach (see below)

## Meeting Coordination
Discuss, decide upon, and answer the following questions:

What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)
* Text group chat.

How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?
* Communicate through the text group chat.

What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?
* Face to face, if not then communicate through the text group chat.

Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary? Describe them.
* None
