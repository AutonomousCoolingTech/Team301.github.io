How will your team communicate (e.g., group text, email, Canvas, slack, discord, telephone)? 
Consider the need for both asynchronous and synchronous discussion types, and the expectations that come with each mode of communication.
* We have all agreed that we will communicate through text (personal cell phones). We already created a text group chat with everyone involved.

How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?
* Since we are a team, everyone is expected to be responsible. Communication with each other will be in person and through text, depending on whether we are all there present or not.

## Team Goals
Ensuring that our device can benefit the user and help them within different environments with changing conditions
Deepen our expertise with different operating systems with new and improved features (sensors)
Getting started early on our project to have the most benefits with troubleshooting and correcting while being ahead of the project schedule
Making sure that our product can be operable during different environments and can be small and portable enough to be taken anywhere
Ensuring that our product can possibly assist and help our users within different and dangerous conditions with its warning systems and cooling systems

## Team Mission Statement
Our team’s mission is to create and sell a product that will ensure proper safety conditions within different environments when working with a mobile weather station. Our goal is to ensure that our device can properly detect dangerous changes within different environments and help the user become aware of said changes along with providing some emergency relief for these changes.

## Meeting Schedule
Your team should identify common times for meeting every week. If you are not meeting weekly, your team's chances of success this semester are low
Fill out the linked template. Put abbreviations next to hours in the week you are certain you will be generally available throughout the semester. Consider external hard constraints in a typical week, such as other classes, work, transit, meals, or family commitments.
Identify at least four hours shared by the team outside of class time.
Select a weekly meeting slot (it can be changed later, but you should try one for the first couple weeks).
Add the meeting to your team's agreed-upon scheduling approach (see below)

## Meeting Coordination
Discuss, decide upon, and answer the following questions:

What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)
* Text group chat.

How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?
* Communicate through the text group chat.

What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?
* Face to face, if not then communicate through the text group chat.

Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary? Describe them.
* None

How often will you change project roles?
* When it is necessary and have a group discussion regarding it.

How will you decide who is assigned to each role?
* As a team and have an agreement upon it.

How will team members help one another meet their responsibilities?
* Having to remind them of their responsibilities and create a safe discussion regarding it,

How will you identify and respond to situations in which the team must adjust roles and responsibilities?
* Have a team meeting about it and come to a conclusion on what is best for the team.

How will you track the team activities and milestones?
* Through the group chat.

How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members?
* Communicate as a team and have those assigned.

## Team Coordination & Accountability
Discuss, decide upon, and answer how you will:

Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has "signed off" on each submitted assignment?
* Text the group chat as a reminder what needs to be done.

Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and how will you adjust if not?
* As a team we will teach and help each other when something is not understood. If more help is needed and there is a lack of communication we will reach out to the professor for assistance.

Ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team?
* Have a team meeting and have that discussion to correct it.

Additionally, describe how you will:

Address missed contributions/assignments/actions?
* Have a team meeting and discuss the reasons behind it.

Hold one another accountable to the expectations described in this charter.
* Have a discussion about it with one another and ensure it is fixed.

Recognize that a team member is underperforming.
* Have a team meeting and discuss the reasons behind it.

Help an underperforming team member improve.
* Have a team meeting and discuss the reasons behind it.

What are the consequences if an underperforming team member does not improve (e.g., pink slip)?
* Have a team meeting with the professor and discuss it as a team to have it resolved, if there are no changes a “pink slip” will be enforced.

Conflict Recognition & Resolution
* Considering we are all college students and share the same passion for engineering. I believe we will be able to have a sit down discussion regarding any problems whether good or bad. We will communicate with each other and make sure we are all on the same page. If it tends to be more serious, we will have one “chill” day to be able to calm down and rethink our discussion and come back together as a team and resolve it. Last resort is involving the professor in our discussions to solve any conflicts.

# User Needs, Benchmarkings, and Requirements

1. Voice of the Customer Benchmarking
* Commercial product relation: Fan with thermostat control

Explicit statements:
* Consumer stated, “COOL AIR FROM THE VENT IS NOT THE ROOM TEMPERATURE! I set it at 70 and within a minute it powers down because I hit the temperature. Room was still 77.”
* Consumer stated, “ It was very little air continues to switch back to Celsius.”
* Consumer stated, “Guess partly my fault for not reading clearly but with the cord on this it cannot be used on a ceiling vent. Had to return it.”
* Consumer stated, “It's like a laptop fan on full speed, lots of noise, no air movement. It blocks literally 95% of the air duct so even when the fan is on high.”
* Consumer stated, “The unit has 2 separate fans. One of the blades is broken. There is a rattling noise coming from inside.”
* Consumer stated, “The fans stopped coming on, even though it's reading the correct temps. Sometimes if I hit them the fans will kick on, but I'm not going to do that every time and I don't consider that to be "working".”
* Consumer stated, “The fans are not powerful, the room temperature was cooler before we installed them.”
* Consumer stated, “Opened and didn’t come with all its parts.”
* Consumer stated, “The unit came with no instructions.”

Latent statements:
* Consumer stated. “This does nothing for your air vent. Keep your regular one on.”
* Consumer stated, “The fans are not powerful.”
* Consumer stated, “Product worked for a short period of time and then quit.”
* Consumer stated, “This fan isn’t quiet and makes a loud humming buzzing noise. I wouldn’t recommend it.”
* Consumer stated, “within 3 months the product completely quit working.”
* Consumer stated, “Sadly it was dead on arrival. Plugged it in and nothing happened. I even switched outlets to ensure it wasn’t the outlet not having power.”
* Consumer stated, “It made no difference with full fan speed. Not worth it.”
* Consumer stated, “Product does not work as advertised, will not turn on automatically. All settings are correct and instructions read front to back.”
* Consumer stated, “May have been a small improvement. Anything above the first few fan settings and it's anything but quiet. Ultimately it is a poor value for the cost. It's basically a $10 from the hardware store with a small fans. Nothing impressive.”

Top 5 Related Products

**Product 1 (three positive and three negative statements): BIOWIND Quit Register Booster**
* Consumer stated, “It's easy to install, quiet, efficient, and has all the features I never knew I needed. Plus, it's so smart it's almost funny! “
* Consumer stated, “I got this during a 25% off promotion but would have bought it for full price. It's made all the difference turning my previous sweat lodge into a comfortable bedroom in the summer! Would DEFINITELY buy again!”
* Consumer stated, “ the room is noticeably cooler than the rest of the floor.”
* Consumer stated, “Each of these units contains a pair of tiny computer fans. Even at top speed, they don’t move enough volume of air to make a big difference. If your vents are deep enough (mine are not) invest in a “squirrel cage” booster fan with an actual CFM rating.”
* Consumer stated, “For my experience, the room temperature was hindered rather than helped by this product.”
* Consumer stated, “Unable to use this product. Had the right length and width size, but depth of the fan box did not fit into our duct.”

**Product 2 (three positive and three negative statements): Personal Air Conditioner**
* Consumer stated, “It last me a little over an hour during my early morning walks here in Florida when's it's 79f with 80% humidity at 7am. Feels great and keeps me just that much cooler that I am not a sweaty mess in 15 minutes. Love it and use it everyday. I freeze mine in the freezer.”
* Consumer stated, “These rings work well. The cooling lasts for a while in Texas heat. My only disappointment is that from the picture I thought I was getting a pack of four but I only received one ring.”
* Consumer stated, “It gets frozen quick it keep cool and not cold at just the right temperature. For me it lasted about 1hr, so I ended up getting a 2nd one so I can use it in rotation. Now it's perfect.”
* Consumer stated, “I bought the jumbo size because it was described to stay cold up to 60-90 minutes. I froze mine completely and it was melted/thawed to original state in less than 30 minutes. A waste of money. Do not recommend.”
* Consumer stated, “Way too small to fit around a normal man's neck. Returning.”
* Consumer stated, “Does not stay cold and is not very cold even when frozen.”

**Product 3 (three positive and three negative statements): Everlasting comfort cool mist humidifiers for bedroom**
* Customer stated, “Easy to use, lasts forever and works very well and is quiet!”
* Consumer stated, “I could not be happier with this. I bought this for my plants and I have very happy plants now! Holds a ton of water. It’s going on day three now without having to fill it back up. Amazing quality. Decent price. Quick delivery. Easy to use. Really no complaints.”
* Consumer stated, “Easy to use works all through the night.”
* Consumer stated, “THE ITEM IS MUCH TOO HEAVY AND AWKWARD.”
* Consumer stated, “I’ve tried 2 of these. It is not a good design. The mist wets everything around it and then it needs to dry for a month before it works again. Steer clear of this one.”
* Consumer stated, “This humidifier seems really poorly made.”

**4. Product 4 (three positive and three negative statements): Dreo Tower Fan**
* Consumer stated, “It's so easy to use. I LOVE the fact it has a remote. It's fairly powerful.”
* Consumer stated, “Speed: It has 4 amazing silent yet powerful speeds. It energy efficient and can cool down your room all with super powerful speed.”
* Consumer stated, “It was easy to assemble. I’m pleased with the oscillating feature. Overall, this is a high quality fan for a fair price.”
* Consumer stated, “Bought this fan just over a month ago and stopped working completely this morning”
* Consumer stated, “It will not power on and I have tried it in multiple different outlets. “
* Consumer stated, “This fan died the 2nd day of use. It is not quiet. It is louder than well made circular fan. I am very dissapointed.”

**Product 5 (three positive and three negative statements): Baldr Digital Thermometer Hygrometer**
* Consumer states, “Accurate, easy to read display. Not too big or too small. Stable base, can be wall mounted. No issues. Recommended.”
* Consumer states, “Great product with a high and low reading per day. Temperature and humidity readings.”
* Consumer states, “Seems to work well. The temp on this unit is the same as the thermostat temp.”
* Consumer states, “Liked the high and low temp and humidity. Update... part of number for humidity went out after 2 days. No response from seller. Hence the 1 star until I receive support or resolve issue.”
* Consumer states, “original product had small issue with display.”
* Consumer states, “Digits stopped showing at different part of the number, making it impossible to use.”
