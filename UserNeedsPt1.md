1. Voice of the Customer Benchmarking
* Commercial product relation: Fan with thermostat control

Explicit statements:
* Consumer stated, “COOL AIR FROM THE VENT IS NOT THE ROOM TEMPERATURE! I set it at 70 and within a minute it powers down because I hit the temperature. Room was still 77.”
* Consumer stated, “ It was very little air continues to switch back to Celsius.”
* Consumer stated, “Guess partly my fault for not reading clearly but with the cord on this it cannot be used on a ceiling vent. Had to return it.”
* Consumer stated, “It's like a laptop fan on full speed, lots of noise, no air movement. It blocks literally 95% of the air duct so even when the fan is on high.”
* Consumer stated, “The unit has 2 separate fans. One of the blades is broken. There is a rattling noise coming from inside.”
* Consumer stated, “The fans stopped coming on, even though it's reading the correct temps. Sometimes if I hit them the fans will kick on, but I'm not going to do that every time and I don't consider that to be "working".”
* Consumer stated, “The fans are not powerful, the room temperature was cooler before we installed them.”
* Consumer stated, “Opened and didn’t come with all its parts.”
* Consumer stated, “The unit came with no instructions.”

Latent statements:
* Consumer stated. “This does nothing for your air vent. Keep your regular one on.”
* Consumer stated, “The fans are not powerful.”
* Consumer stated, “Product worked for a short period of time and then quit.”
* Consumer stated, “This fan isn’t quiet and makes a loud humming buzzing noise. I wouldn’t recommend it.”
* Consumer stated, “within 3 months the product completely quit working.”
* Consumer stated, “Sadly it was dead on arrival. Plugged it in and nothing happened. I even switched outlets to ensure it wasn’t the outlet not having power.”
* Consumer stated, “It made no difference with full fan speed. Not worth it.”
* Consumer stated, “Product does not work as advertised, will not turn on automatically. All settings are correct and instructions read front to back.”
* Consumer stated, “May have been a small improvement. Anything above the first few fan settings and it's anything but quiet. Ultimately it is a poor value for the cost. It's basically a $10 from the hardware store with a small fans. Nothing impressive.”

**Product 1 (three positive and three negative statements): BIOWIND Quit Register Booster**
* Consumer stated, “It's easy to install, quiet, efficient, and has all the features I never knew I needed. Plus, it's so smart it's almost funny! “
* Consumer stated, “I got this during a 25% off promotion but would have bought it for full price. It's made all the difference turning my previous sweat lodge into a comfortable bedroom in the summer! Would DEFINITELY buy again!”
* Consumer stated, “ the room is noticeably cooler than the rest of the floor.”
* Consumer stated, “Each of these units contains a pair of tiny computer fans. Even at top speed, they don’t move enough volume of air to make a big difference. If your vents are deep enough (mine are not) invest in a “squirrel cage” booster fan with an actual CFM rating.”
* Consumer stated, “For my experience, the room temperature was hindered rather than helped by this product.”
* Consumer stated, “Unable to use this product. Had the right length and width size, but depth of the fan box did not fit into our duct.”

**Product 2 (three positive and three negative statements): Personal Air Conditioner**
* Consumer stated, “It last me a little over an hour during my early morning walks here in Florida when's it's 79f with 80% humidity at 7am. Feels great and keeps me just that much cooler that I am not a sweaty mess in 15 minutes. Love it and use it everyday. I freeze mine in the freezer.”
* Consumer stated, “These rings work well. The cooling lasts for a while in Texas heat. My only disappointment is that from the picture I thought I was getting a pack of four but I only received one ring.”
* Consumer stated, “It gets frozen quick it keep cool and not cold at just the right temperature. For me it lasted about 1hr, so I ended up getting a 2nd one so I can use it in rotation. Now it's perfect.”
* Consumer stated, “I bought the jumbo size because it was described to stay cold up to 60-90 minutes. I froze mine completely and it was melted/thawed to original state in less than 30 minutes. A waste of money. Do not recommend.”
* Consumer stated, “Way too small to fit around a normal man's neck. Returning.”
* Consumer stated, “Does not stay cold and is not very cold even when frozen.”

* Consumer stated, “Easy to use works all through the night.”
* Consumer stated, “THE ITEM IS MUCH TOO HEAVY AND AWKWARD.”
* Consumer stated, “I’ve tried 2 of these. It is not a good design. The mist wets everything around it and then it needs to dry for a month before it works again. Steer clear of this one.”
