How will your team communicate (e.g., group text, email, Canvas, slack, discord, telephone)? 
Consider the need for both asynchronous and synchronous discussion types, and the expectations that come with each mode of communication.
* We have all agreed that we will communicate through text (personal cell phones). We already created a text group chat with everyone involved.

How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?
* Since we are a team, everyone is expected to be responsible. Communication with each other will be in person and through text, depending on whether we are all there present or not.

## Team Goals
Ensuring that our device can benefit the user and help them within different environments with changing conditions
Deepen our expertise with different operating systems with new and improved features (sensors)
Getting started early on our project to have the most benefits with troubleshooting and correcting while being ahead of the project schedule
Making sure that our product can be operable during different environments and can be small and portable enough to be taken anywhere
Ensuring that our product can possibly assist and help our users within different and dangerous conditions with its warning systems and cooling systems

## Team Mission Statement
Our team’s mission is to create and sell a product that will ensure proper safety conditions within different environments when working with a mobile weather station. Our goal is to ensure that our device can properly detect dangerous changes within different environments and help the user become aware of said changes along with providing some emergency relief for these changes.

## Meeting Schedule
Your team should identify common times for meeting every week. If you are not meeting weekly, your team's chances of success this semester are low
Fill out the linked template. Put abbreviations next to hours in the week you are certain you will be generally available throughout the semester. Consider external hard constraints in a typical week, such as other classes, work, transit, meals, or family commitments.
Identify at least four hours shared by the team outside of class time.
Select a weekly meeting slot (it can be changed later, but you should try one for the first couple weeks).
Add the meeting to your team's agreed-upon scheduling approach (see below)

## Meeting Coordination
Discuss, decide upon, and answer the following questions:

What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)
* Text group chat.

How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?
* Communicate through the text group chat.

What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?
* Face to face, if not then communicate through the text group chat.

Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary? Describe them.
* None

How often will you change project roles?
* When it is necessary and have a group discussion regarding it.

How will you decide who is assigned to each role?
* As a team and have an agreement upon it.

How will team members help one another meet their responsibilities?
* Having to remind them of their responsibilities and create a safe discussion regarding it,

How will you identify and respond to situations in which the team must adjust roles and responsibilities?
* Have a team meeting about it and come to a conclusion on what is best for the team.

How will you track the team activities and milestones?
* Through the group chat.

How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members?
* Communicate as a team and have those assigned.

## Team Coordination & Accountability
Discuss, decide upon, and answer how you will:

Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has "signed off" on each submitted assignment?
* Text the group chat as a reminder what needs to be done.

Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and how will you adjust if not?
* As a team we will teach and help each other when something is not understood. If more help is needed and there is a lack of communication we will reach out to the professor for assistance.

Ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team?
* Have a team meeting and have that discussion to correct it.

Additionally, describe how you will:

Address missed contributions/assignments/actions?
* Have a team meeting and discuss the reasons behind it.

Hold one another accountable to the expectations described in this charter.
* Have a discussion about it with one another and ensure it is fixed.

Recognize that a team member is underperforming.
* Have a team meeting and discuss the reasons behind it.

Help an underperforming team member improve.
* Have a team meeting and discuss the reasons behind it.

What are the consequences if an underperforming team member does not improve (e.g., pink slip)?
* Have a team meeting with the professor and discuss it as a team to have it resolved, if there are no changes a “pink slip” will be enforced.

Conflict Recognition & Resolution
* Considering we are all college students and share the same passion for engineering. I believe we will be able to have a sit down discussion regarding any problems whether good or bad. We will communicate with each other and make sure we are all on the same page. If it tends to be more serious, we will have one “chill” day to be able to calm down and rethink our discussion and come back together as a team and resolve it. Last resort is involving the professor in our discussions to solve any conflicts.
